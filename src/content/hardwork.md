Everyone wants a life that's hassle free where only a minimal workload is in their plate and they can just let the day pass by. Well most of us tend to aim towards a life like that but maybe this blog might give some clarity upon why that might not be the best. These are mine personal views so feel free to send your feedbacks at hi@sarg.am

    

There's a difference between unemployed and unemployable people. The latter one is something that I constantly aim for. In my words "unemployable people" are those who have the right skill set for most fields despite they have their own pipeline which makes them not rely upon anyone else basically self employed.

    

I have been through both lives, unemployed and employed with 5 other things going on. I work for a companies, go to university, spend time with friends and so much more. For me I typically seem to enjoy the busy days where I need to make a lot of progress and a lot of things in my plate. This gives me joy whenever I finish a lit of things one by one gives me a lot of satisfaction. But on the other side, when I have got no work at all or my day is completely empty. I tend to slack a lot and not even finish a simple task that will probably take 1 hour properly. So, I think adding light excercise or a gym session to a day is a great way to make the day busy and get more things done. (only if I also followed the same)

    

As said in "an empty mind is a devil's workshop". It's true when we have nothing serious or impact to do life feels without a purpose or something that we just do for the sake of living. There's much fun in life when you know you have a purpose to work for a tiny dent to change the whole universe.

    

Also, on the goal of being unemployable, I think staying busy is a great trick to not get comforatable and stay away from working hard. It creates a guilty feeling that whatever you are doing might not be enough. Which then creates a series of small tweaks that makes us foster.
